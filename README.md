üìà Example Query
The following example demonstrates how to retrieve the top 5 highest-paid employees in each department:

-- Sample query to find the top 5 highest-paid employees in each department
```sql
WITH RankedSalaries AS (

    SELECT Department, EmployeeName, Salary,
           ROW_NUMBER() OVER (PARTITION BY Department ORDER BY Salary DESC) AS SalaryRank
    FROM Employees
    
)
SELECT Department, EmployeeName, Salary
FROM RankedSalaries
WHERE SalaryRank <= 5;
```



This query uses a Common Table Expression (CTE) and window functions to rank employees by salary within each department, returning only the top 5 highest-paid employees per department.

üìå Additional Example Queries
1. Join Query: Find All Employees and Their Departments
Retrieve employee details along with their department names using an inner join.

```sql

SELECT e.EmployeeName, e.EmployeeID, d.DepartmentName
FROM Employees e
INNER JOIN Departments d ON e.DepartmentID = d.DepartmentID;
```
This query joins the Employees table with the Departments table based on a common column, DepartmentID, to list all employees along with their department names.

2. Subquery: List Employees Earning Above the Company‚Äôs Average Salary
Find all employees who earn a salary above the company's average.

```sql

SELECT EmployeeName, Salary
FROM Employees
WHERE Salary > (SELECT AVG(Salary) FROM Employees);
```
This query uses a subquery to calculate the average salary in the Employees table and then filters employees with a salary above this average.

3. Window Function: Calculate Running Total of Sales by Date
Show daily sales along with a running total for each day.

```sql

SELECT SaleDate, SalesAmount,
       SUM(SalesAmount) OVER (ORDER BY SaleDate) AS RunningTotal
FROM Sales;
```
Using a window function, this query computes a running total of SalesAmount ordered by SaleDate.

4. Aggregation and Grouping: Count Employees in Each Department
Count the number of employees in each department.

```sql

SELECT DepartmentID, COUNT(EmployeeID) AS EmployeeCount
FROM Employees
GROUP BY DepartmentID
ORDER BY EmployeeCount DESC;
```
This query groups employees by DepartmentID and counts them, providing the number of employees per department, sorted in descending order.

5. Self-Join: Find Employees with the Same Manager
List pairs of employees who report to the same manager.

```sql

SELECT e1.EmployeeName AS Employee1, e2.EmployeeName AS Employee2, e1.ManagerID
FROM Employees e1
JOIN Employees e2 ON e1.ManagerID = e2.ManagerID
WHERE e1.EmployeeID < e2.EmployeeID;
```
By self-joining the Employees table, this query finds all pairs of employees (Employee1 and Employee2) who share the same ManagerID.

6. Common Table Expression (CTE): Find Top N Products by Sales
Using a CTE to retrieve the top 3 products based on total sales.

```sql

WITH ProductSales AS (
    SELECT ProductID, SUM(SalesAmount) AS TotalSales
    FROM Sales
    GROUP BY ProductID
)
SELECT ProductID, TotalSales
FROM ProductSales
ORDER BY TotalSales DESC
LIMIT 3;
```
This query creates a temporary result set (ProductSales) using a CTE and then selects the top 3 products based on total sales.

7. Index Optimization Example: Optimizing a Search Query
Example of creating an index to optimize queries on frequently searched columns.

```sql

CREATE INDEX idx_employee_department ON Employees (DepartmentID);
Creating an index on DepartmentID can speed up queries that frequently search by department, like SELECT * FROM Employees WHERE DepartmentID = 3.
```

8. Conditional Aggregation: Count Employees by Job Title and Department
Get the count of employees by job title within each department.

```sql

SELECT DepartmentID,
       SUM(CASE WHEN JobTitle = 'Manager' THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) AS ManagerCount,
       SUM(CASE WHEN JobTitle = 'Developer' THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) AS DeveloperCount
FROM Employees
GROUP BY DepartmentID;
```
This query uses conditional aggregation to count employees in specific job roles within each department.
